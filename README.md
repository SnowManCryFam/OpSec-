**Top Tips**
1. NEVER give your private key to anyone.
2. Validate users, validate contracts, validate tokens......
3. Do NOT click links from unknown sources. If the source is known still be cautious.
4. Use a Virtual Machine with a VPN for everything crypto related, set everything up, take a snapshot then revert often to the baseline.
5. Use a unique email address for crypto and compartamentalize different emails with different uses. (e.g. have an email for crypto, online shopping, bills, etc)
6. Have a PO box for all crypto related deliveries and use a fake name.
8. Always update applications and operating systems asap.
9. Use a sandbox like browserling.com to check url links. 
10. Use browser extensions like Ublock Origin, Privacy Badger, HTTPS Everywhere.
11. Do not torrent, as this is a easy way to get infected by malware, viruses, keyloggers. 
12. Have multifactor authentication for all apps that support (more below).
13. Use Metamask with a hardware wallet.
14. Plan for your eventual death and have redundancies in place to make sure your loved ones do not loose out.
15. If you sign up for newletters and they ask for your first and last name, put in the website after your last name in the text box or better yet give fake names.This is so you will know who sells your data and how you are all of a sudden getting spammed.

## Phishing (It can happen to anyone, all it takes is a moment of weakness)
- Watch for grammatical errors, generic greetings, urgent requests. 
- Do not download attachments received from unknown sources, do not enable macros as they can enable an attacker to access your computer. 
- Do not provide any sensitive information over email.
- If there is a URL in the email body, hover over the URL to see where it directs. 
- Ignore all shortened URLS, as they are commonly used by malicious attackers for obfuscation purposes. 
- Take your time and if you are not sure, dont click. 
- Ignore popups. 
- Do not open any file you are not expecting. PDF, EXE, VBS, RTF, DOC, XLS, JPEG, ZIP, HTA, and more can all contain viruses.

> Hackers are always coming up with new techniques, be aware, be cautious, be alert. If in doubt ignore and delete. 

## Vishing (Phone Phishing)
- Do not be pressured to do anything or provide information to anyone you do not know on the phone. 
- If you do not know the number, you don't have to pickup.

## Credential Management 
### Various Sites
| Web site  | purpose   | Link |
| :-------------   | :----------   | :----------   |
| Have I Been Pwned? | Check your existing email addresses, if the email address is found in any data breach, make sure to change | https://haveibeenpwned.com/   |
|Two Factor Auth| (probably best to mention SMS 2FA is susceptible to simswaps, best to use a software or hardware tokens, and never setup with SMS MFA) |   |

### Password Managers - Use a password manager with unique random passwords on every single site
| Password Manager | Link                         |
| :-------------   | :----------                 |
| Bitwarden      |   https://bitwarden.com/     |
| Keepass        |   https://keepass.info/      |
| 1Password      |   https://1password.com/     |
| LastPass       |   https://www.lastpass.com/  |

### 2FA/MFA Applications (Use a one time password whereever possible not SMS)
- Google Authenticator
- DUO Security 
- Authy
- Microsoft Authenticator
- LastPass Authenticator
> Note: If you are worried about losing the QR code used to add each MFA app account, you could use a digital camera, or old phone. 
> - Step 1: Start setting up MFA for app you want to enable MFA for. 
> - Step 2: When you get to scanning the QR code, save the secret code in a password manager, as well as take a picture on an old phone thats wifi is disabled. 
> - Step 3: Open the picture of the QR code on the old phone that doesnt have internet access. 
> - Step 4: Scan the QR code picture that is on your old phone using the MFA app on your good phone. This is to check that the picture is good enough quality. Make sure to never upload those to the cloud or store on an computer, as whomever has the image has the time based one time password (TOTP) for that app that changes every 30 seconds. 

## Android & iOS
- Never sideload applications.
- Review the applications permissions.
- Check that the phone is encrypted. 
- Have a password or pin, and never leave unattended in public. 

## Hardware Wallets (GOOGLE the hardware wallets in the articles, always be cautious of links)
